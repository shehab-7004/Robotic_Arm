# Arduino Robotic Arm with Python and Computer Vision

(Videos/video.mp4)

## Overview
This project is a robotic arm controlled using **Arduino** and **servo motors**, fully driven by **Python**.  
It integrates **computer vision** for object detection and manipulation, allowing precise, automated arm movements **without additional sensors**.

## Features
- Arduino-based servo control
- Python software interface
- Real-time computer vision object detection
- Fully automated arm movements
- No extra sensors required

## Hardware
- Arduino board
- 5 Servo motors (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky)
- Mechanical arm structure

## Software
- Python 3
- OpenCV for computer vision
- PySerial for Arduino communication

## Usage
1. Connect Arduino and upload the provided code.
2. Run the Python script to start the computer vision interface.
3. The arm will track and manipulate objects based on camera input.

## Video Demo
The project demo is included in the repository:
